This Program is intended to be used with and modify existing code (the "Modded Code") and to build a robust modding community with open source principles. The purpose of this exception is to address issues when an open source modding community interacts with potentially proprietary code. In addition, the modding community often uses libraries (the "Modding Libraries") under licenses that may be incompatible with the GPL ("Modding Library Licenses").
