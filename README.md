## Developing with CommonLibSF

### Using the CommonLibSF plugin template

A plugin template is provided at https://github.com/Starfield-Reverse-Engineering/CLibSFPluginTemplate. Clone the repo and run the project setup script to get started developing your plugin without having to worry about setting things up.

### Including CommonLibSF in your project

#### vcpkg

[Instructions for consuming CommonLibSF using vcpkg are provided at our vcpkg registry repo.](https://github.com/Starfield-Reverse-Engineering/Starfield-RE-vcpkg)

#### git submodule

To consume CommonLibSF as a submodule, `cd` into your project directory and run:

```ps
git submodule add https://github.com/Starfield-Reverse-Engineering/CommonLibSF extern/CommonLibSF
git submodule update -f --init
```

Then add the following to your `CMakeLists.txt`:

```cmake
add_subdirectory(extern/CommonLibSF)
target_link_libraries(
  ${PROJECT_NAME}
  PRIVATE
  CommonLibSF::CommonLibSF
)
```

## End-User Dependencies

[Starfield Script Extender](https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield/mods/106)

## Notes

CommonLibSF is incompatible with SFSE and is intended to replace it as a static dependency&mdash;the runtime component is still required.
